It also ensures that the exit-function is called only **once**.\n\nYou should use this module when your write a npm-library where you dont know in which environments the users will run it.\n\n# What does `unload` handle?\n\nWhen nodejs:\n```js\nprocess.on('beforeExit');\nprocess.on('exit');\nprocess.on('SIGINT'); // catches ctrl+c event\nprocess.on('uncaughtException'); // catches uncaught exceptions\n```\n\nWhen browser:\n```js\nwindow.addEventListener('beforeunload'); // closing of normal browser-window\nwindow.addEventListener('unload'); // closed inside of iframe\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nInstallation:\n\n`npm install unload --save`\n\nAdd a function which runs when the process exits:\n\n```javascript\nvar unload = require('unload');\nunload.add(function(){\n    console.log('Ouch, I\\'m dying.');\n});\n```\n\nAdd and remove the function (It will no longer run when the process exits):\n\n```javascript\nvar unload = require('unload');\nvar ret = unload.add(function(){\n    console.log('Ouch, I\\'m dying.');\n});\n\nret.remove(); // removes the event-handler\n```\n\nRun all previously added functions:\n\n```javascript\nvar unload = require('unload');\nunload.add(function(){\n    console.log('Ouch, I\\'m dying.');\n});\n\nunload.runAll();\n```\n\nRemove all added functions (They will no longer run when the process exits):\n```javascript\nvar unload = require('unload');\nunload.add(function(){\n    console.log('Ouch, I\\'m dying.');\n});\n\nunload.removeAll();\n```\n",
