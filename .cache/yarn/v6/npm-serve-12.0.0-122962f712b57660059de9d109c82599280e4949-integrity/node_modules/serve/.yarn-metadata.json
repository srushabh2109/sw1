[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device\n2. Uninstall `serve` if it's already installed: `npm uninstall -g serve`\n3. Link it to the global module directory: `npm link`\n\nAfter that, you can use the `serve` command everywhere. [Here](https://github.com/vercel/serve/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+for+beginners%22)'s a list of issues that are great for beginners.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project used to be called \"list\" and \"micro-list\". But thanks to [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) handing us the new name, it's now called \"serve\" (which is much more definite).\n\n## Author\n\nLeo Lamprecht ([@notquiteleo](https://twitter.com/notquiteleo)) - [Vercel](https://vercel.com)\n",
