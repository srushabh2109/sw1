They are primarily for internal use and developers are expected to use the publicly exposed API in the [various endpoint services](https://www.npmjs.com/org/sendgrid).\n\nTo be notified when this package is updated, please subscribe to email [notifications](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/nodejs) for releases and breaking changes.\n\n## Mail class\nUsed to compose a `Mail` object that converts itself to proper JSON for use with the [SendGrid v3 API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/api_v3.html). This class supports a slightly different API to make sending emails easier in many cases by not having to deal with personalization arrays, instead offering a more straightforward interface for composing emails.\n\n## Attachment class\nUsed by the inbound mail parser to compose `Attachment` objects.\n\n## Personalization class\nUsed by the Mail class to compose `Personalization` objects.\n\n## Email address\n`Helper` class to represent an email address with name/email. Used by both the `Mail` and `Personalization` classes to deal with email addresses of various formats.\n\n## Helpers\nInternal helpers that mostly speak for themselves.\n\n<a name=\"contribute\"></a>\n# How to Contribute\n\nWe encourage contribution to our libraries (you might even score some nifty swag), please see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details.\n\n* [Feature Request](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-request)\n* [Bug Reports](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-a-bug-report)\n* [Improvements to the Codebase](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#improvements-to-the-codebase)\n\n<a name=\"about\"></a>\n# About\n\n@sendgrid/helpers are guided and supported by the Twilio SendGrid [Developer Experience Team](mailto:dx@sendgrid.com).\n\n@sendgrid/helpers are maintained and funded by Twilio SendGrid, Inc.
