Most browsers have [built-in support](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-dir) for displaying markup like paragraphs, lists, and tables. But what about interactive or complex custom UI components? In a right-to-left layout, a photo carousel should advance in the opposite direction, and the primary tab in a navigation control should the rightmost, for example.\n\nThis package provides components to simplify that effort.\n\n## withDirection\n\nUse `withDirection` when your component needs to change based on the layout direction. `withDirection` is an HOC that consumes the direction from React context and passes it as a `direction` prop to the wrapped component. The wrapped component can then pivot its logic to accommodate each direction.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js\nimport withDirection, { withDirectionPropTypes, DIRECTIONS } from 'react-with-direction';\n\nfunction ForwardsLabel({ direction }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Forwards\n      {direction === DIRECTIONS.LTR && <img src=\"arrow-right.png\" />}\n      {direction === DIRECTIONS.RTL && <img src=\"arrow-left.png\" />}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nForwardsLabel.propTypes = {\n  ...withDirectionPropTypes,\n};\n\nexport default withDirection(ForwardsLabel);\n```\n\n## DirectionProvider\n\nUse `DirectionProvider` at the top of your app to set the direction context, which can then be consumed by components using `withDirection`.\n\nYou should set the `direction` prop based on the language of the content being rendered; for example, `DIRECTIONS.RTL` (right-to-left) for Arabic or Hebrew, or `DIRECTIONS.LTR` (left-to-right) for English or most other languages.\n\n`DirectionProvider` components can also be nested, so that the direction can be overridden for certain branches of the React tree.\n\n`DirectionProvider` will render its children inside of a `<div>` element with a `dir` attribute set to match the `direction` prop, for example: `<div dir=\"rtl\">`. This maintains consistency when being rendered in a browser. To render inside of a `<span>` instead of a div, set the `inline` prop to `true`.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js\nimport DirectionProvider, { DIRECTIONS } from 'react-with-direction/dist/DirectionProvider';\n```\n\n```js\n<DirectionProvider direction={DIRECTIONS.RTL}>\n  <div>\n    <ForwardsLabel />\n  </div>\n</DirectionProvider>\n```\n\n## AutoDirectionProvider\n\nUse `AutoDirectionProvider` around, for example, user-generated content where the text direction is unknown or may change. This renders a `DirectionProvider` with the `direction` prop automatically set based on the `text` prop provided.\n\nDirection will be determined based on the first strong LTR/RTL character in the `text` string. Strings with no strong direction (e.g., numbers) will inherit the direction from its nearest `DirectionProvider` ancestor or default to LTR.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```js\nimport AutoDirectionProvider from 'react-with-direction/dist/AutoDirectionProvider';\n```\n\n```js\n<AutoDirectionProvider text={userGeneratedContent}>\n  <ExampleComponent>\n    {userGeneratedContent}\n  </ExampleComponent>\n</AutoDirectionProvider>\n```\n\n[package-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/react-with-direction\n[npm-version-svg]: http://versionbadg.es/airbnb/react-with-direction.svg\n[travis-svg]: https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/react-with-direction.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/react-with-direction\n[deps-svg]: https://david-dm.org/airbnb/react-with-direction.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/airbnb/react-with-direction\n[dev-deps-svg]: https://david-dm.org/airbnb/react-with-direction/dev-status.svg\n[dev-deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/airbnb/react-with-direction#info=devDependencies\n[npm-badge-png]: https://nodei.co/npm/react-with-direction.png?downloads=true&stars=true\n[license-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/l/react-with-direction.svg\n[license-url]: LICENSE\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-with-direction.svg\n[downloads-url]: http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react-with-direction\n",
