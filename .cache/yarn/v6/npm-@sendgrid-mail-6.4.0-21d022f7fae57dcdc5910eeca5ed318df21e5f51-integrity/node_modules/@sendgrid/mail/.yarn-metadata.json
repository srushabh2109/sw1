Instead, use an environment variable or some other secure means of protecting your Twilio SendGrid API Key. Following is an example of using an environment variable.\n\nUpdate the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:\n\n```bash\necho \"export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'\" > sendgrid.env\necho \"sendgrid.env\" >> .gitignore\nsource ./sendgrid.env\n```\n\n## Install Package\n\nThe following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x, therefore, you likely already have it.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @sendgrid/mail\n```\n\nYou may also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install.\n\n```sh\nyarn add @sendgrid/mail\n```\n\n<a name=\"quick-start\"></a>\n# Quick Start, Hello Email\n\nThe following is the minimum needed code to send a simple email. Use this example, and modify the `to` and `from` variables:\n\nFor more complex use cases, please see [USE_CASES.md](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/use-cases/README.md#email-use-cases).\n\n```js\nconst sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');\nsgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);\nconst msg = {\n  to: 'test@example.com',\n  from: 'test@example.com',\n  subject: 'Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun',\n  text: 'and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js',\n  html: '<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with Node.js</strong>',\n};\nsgMail.send(msg);\n```\n\nAfter executing the above code, you should have an email in the inbox of the recipient. You can check the status of your email [in the UI](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity?). Alternatively, we can post events to a URL of your choice using our [Event Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html). This gives you data about the events that occur as Twilio SendGrid processes your email.\n\n<a name=\"troubleshooting\"></a>\n# Troubleshooting\n\nPlease see our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common library issues.\n\n<a name=\"announcements\"></a>\n# Announcements\n\nAll updates to this library are documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [releases](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/releases).
