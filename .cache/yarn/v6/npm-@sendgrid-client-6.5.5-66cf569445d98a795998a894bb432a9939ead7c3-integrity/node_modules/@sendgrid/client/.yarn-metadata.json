You can also use it independently to make custom requests to the Twilio SendGrid v3 Web API and other HTTP APIs.\n\nTo be notified when this package is updated, please subscribe to email [notifications](https://dx.sendgrid.com/newsletter/nodejs) for releases and breaking changes.\n\n# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js version 6, 7 or 8\n- A Twilio SendGrid account, [sign up for free](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-nodejs) to send up to 40,000 emails for the first 30 days or check out [our pricing](https://sendgrid.com/pricing?source=sendgrid-nodejs).\n\n## Obtain an API Key\n\nGrab your API Key from the [Twilio SendGrid UI](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).\n\n## Setup Environment Variables\n\nDo not hardcode your [Twilio SendGrid API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) into your code. Instead, use an environment variable or some other secure means of protecting your Twilio SendGrid API Key. Following is an example of using an environment variable.\n\nUpdate the development environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), for example:\n\n```bash\necho \"export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'\" > sendgrid.env\necho \"sendgrid.env\" >> .gitignore\nsource ./sendgrid.env\n```\n\n## Install Package\n\nThe following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x, therefore, you likely already have it.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @sendgrid/client\n```\n\nYou may also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install.\n\n```sh\nyarn add @sendgrid/client\n```\n\n<a name=\"general\"></a>\n## General v3 Web API Usage Example\n\nPlease see [USAGE.md](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/packages/client/USAGE.md) for all endpoint examples for the [Twilio SendGrid v3 Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/api_v3.html).\n\n```js\nconst client = require('@sendgrid/client');\nclient.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);\nconst request = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  url: '/v3/api_keys'\n};\nclient.request(request)\n.then(([response, body]) => {\n  console.log(response.statusCode);\n  console.log(body);\n})\n```\n\n## Add a Custom Default Header\n```js\nclient.setDefaultHeader('User-Agent', 'Some user agent string');\n```\n\n## Change Request Defaults\n```js\nclient.setDefaultRequest('baseUrl', 'https://api.sendgrid.com/');\n```\n\n## Overwrite Promise Implementation\nYou can overwrite the promise implementation you want the client to use. Defaults to the ES6 `Promise`:\n\n```js\nglobal.Promise = require('bluebird');\n```\n\n## Instantiate Client Instances Manually\n```js\nconst {Client} = require('@sendgrid/client');\nconst sgClient1 = new Client();\nconst sgClient2 = new Client();\nsgClient1.setApiKey('KEY1');\nsgClient2.setApiKey('KEY2');\n```\n\n<a name=\"announcements\"></a>\n# Announcements\n\nAll updates to this library are documented in our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [releases](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs/releases).
